Instructions to compile and run:
it should just work, because python is interpreted!
./p4500 pathname pathname is the syntax to run the program, as specified in the assignment

The only problem that might happen is if the file does not have permission to be executed.
Fix: chmod a+x p4500
(or whatever other permissions you want to allow it)
